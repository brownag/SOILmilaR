\title{Create a Rating Function to "Cut" Continuous Data}
\usage{
rating_factory_cut(breaks, labels, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{breaks}{A numeric vector of two or more unique cut points.}

\item{labels}{A character vector of labels for the intervals. The number of
labels must be one less than the number of breaks.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed on to \code{base::cut()}, such as
\code{right = FALSE} or \code{include.lowest = TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A new function that takes a single argument (a numeric vector) and
returns an ordered factor.
}
\description{
This is a "function factory" that creates a new rating function that bins
a continuous variable into an ordered factor. It serves as a user-friendly
wrapper around \code{base::cut()}.
}
\examples{
# Define breaks and labels for soil depth
depth_breaks <- c(0, 25, 50, 100, 150)
depth_labels <- c("Very Shallow", "Shallow", "Moderately Deep", "Deep")

# Create the rating function built around base::cut()
rate_depth <- rating_factory_cut(depth_breaks, depth_labels)

# Use the new function
soil_depths <- c(10, 45, 90, 120, 200)
rate_depth(soil_depths)
}
